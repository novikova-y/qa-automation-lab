# QA Automation Playground

![Cypress Tests](https://github.com/novikova-y/qa-automation-lab/actions/workflows/cypress.yml/badge.svg)


This is an advanced QA automation project designed to demonstrate modern testing practices using **Cypress** (initially) and **Playwright** (later). It includes full-stack test coverage across multiple levels, from UI/E2E to API and component testing. The goal is to evaluate and compare tools, patterns, and infrastructure setups in real-world conditions.

## Stack & Scope

### Technologies
- **Cypress**: E2E, UI, component testing
- **Playwright** (planned, for comparison)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Allure / ReportPortal** (planned)
- **Prometheus / Grafana / Elastic** (observability setup planned)

### Testing Focus
- E2E user flows
- UI component tests
- REST API testing
- Custom commands & fixtures
- Test parallelization and optimization
- Integration with CI pipelines and reporting tools
- Target application: [https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

## Project Goals

- Build scalable and maintainable automation architecture.
- Evaluate capabilities and trade-offs between Cypress and Playwright.
- Demonstrate integration with observability and reporting solutions.
- Showcase best practices for test design, stability, and CI/CD integration.
