# QA Automation Lab

![Cypress Tests](https://github.com/novikova-y/qa-automation-lab/actions/workflows/cypress.yml/badge.svg)

This is an advanced QA automation project designed to demonstrate modern testing practices using **Cypress** (initially) and **Playwright** (later).  
It includes full-stack test coverage across multiple levels, from UI/E2E to component testing. The goal is to evaluate and compare tools, patterns, and infrastructure setups in real-world conditions.

## Stack & Scope

### Technologies
- **Cypress**: E2E, UI, component testing
- **Playwright** (planned, for comparison)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Allure** (test reporting)
- **Prometheus / Grafana / Elastic** (observability setup planned)

### Testing Focus
- E2E user flows
- UI component tests
- Performance and reliability testing (planned)
- Accessibility and visual testing (planned)
- Target application: [https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

### Tools & Practices
- Custom commands & fixtures for reusable test logic and data management
- Test parallelization and optimization
- Integration with CI pipelines and reporting tools
- Observability and monitoring integration (planned)

## Project Goals

- Build scalable and maintainable automation architecture.
- Evaluate capabilities and trade-offs between Cypress and Playwright.
- Demonstrate integration with observability and reporting solutions.
- Showcase best practices for test design, stability, and CI/CD integration.
